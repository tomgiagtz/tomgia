In 1986, Craig Reynolds created a model to describe the motion of flocks. These flocks recreated the motion of animals that move in groups, such as fish or birds, and he called these simulated animals boids. With three simple rules, this model creates very naturalistic motion. What follows is a summary of my implementation of this model, using C# and Unity.

Betrayal at the House on the Hill inspired me to recreate a player generated dungeon for the party game, Bean Bandits and the Curse of Skol. In a Mario Party style ‘overworld’, players race through the dungeon to collect 3 gems, then escape through the starting area. After each round, players face off in a minigame.
