          "description": "The Odessa Tree is a 3D puzzle platformer where you control three vessels that are controlled by a single soul. As you explore an abandoned village, you must switch between the vessel characters, and use their light-based abilities to traverse the environment. \n\nEarly on, we wanted each character to be bound to the X, Y, and B buttons on an Xbox controller. The HUD was built to reflect the layout of those buttons. \n\nEach character's ability is based on whether or not they are standing in light. The mushroom's ability is active in darkness, while the robot and plant's abilities are active in light. This was confusing to some players, so the ability indicator shows when an ability is available.\n\nThis HUD and the entire UI were built using CommonUI in Unreal. Using it, I was able to integrate controller UI navigation and input device icons, which change with the active input device.\n\nThe HUD icons were created by @maurasolis (https://www.artstation.com/maurasolis).\n\nNOTE: The HUD size and placement was changed for these recordings.",

          "title": "Stylized Procedural Cliffs",
          "description": "One of the reasons I love Houdini is the ability to automate workflows or processes used in Game Development. This project was inspired by a single 10-second clip in a Game Devlog by Codeer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDTT3Tp42TI). He created rocks in Blender by slicing off the corners and edges until a stylized rock shape formed. I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I did that procedurally? So I did!\n\nI ended up going a step further to create these rocks and merge them to create a fully procedural cliff. The top and bottom of the cliff are defined by two splines that are editable right inside Unreal. A surface is then generated between the two splines and the rocks are scattered onto that surface.\n\nThere is control over the rocks themselves as well as how they are placed onto the cliff. The rock can be controlled on the spectrum from sphere to cube and includes control over the number of facets (slicing iterations). The cliff has controls for the number of rocks to scatter, how densely they are packed, and the scale of the rocks. Density and Scale are controlled via animation curves that can be set in the editor, so they can be controlled in relation to the height of the cliff.\n\nThe material being applied is also fully procedural. The gradient is applied from the bottom to the top of the cliff regardless of its position or rotation in the world. \n\nThis whole setup is driven by a Houdini Digital Asset. Using Houdini Engine, this can be brought into most major DCC engines including Unity and Maya.",

The trees and towers were created procedurally and defined parametrically to fit within the environment.

I think the trees here look pretty bare, mostly due to trying to get the high poly tree from Houdini down to a game-ready level, I definitely want to see what Nanite does with a forest of unique trees with polycounts over 1 million!",

          "description": "Terraria is a great game, but the UI needs some work. No matter how much time you put in, there will always be an element of looking through a dense grid of items to find what you're looking for. This redesign aims to be more accessible and grounded in the world, with filterable lists and utilities to make it easier to find exactly what you're looking for. Both experienced and brand new players will be able to spend less time deciphering what they have or can craft, and more time getting ready for the next boss fight!\n\nBesides original game screens, all assets were made in Photoshop and optimized for real-time use inside Unity.",
